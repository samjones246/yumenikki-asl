LiveSplit autosplitter for [Yume Nikki](https://store.steampowered.com/app/650700/Yume_Nikki/) by Kikiyama

## Usage
This autosplitter is in the LiveSplit autosplitters list, so it will automatically be available in the Edit Splits menu in LiveSplit when you have a Yume Nikki splits file open. From the Edit Splits menu you can activate/deactivate the autosplitter, as well as access its settings. The settings allow you to change your split points, which are set to the following by default:
 - Entering closet
 - Demon/Oni effect acquired
 - Triangle Kerchief/Spirit headband acquired
 - Witch effect acquired


Misc category endings can also be enabled from this screen. Splitting when jumping from the balcony does not have a setting as it is always enabled.
